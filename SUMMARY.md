**The Multi-National Road Damage Dataset 2022** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the automotive industry. 

The dataset consists of 47420 images with 61082 labeled objects belonging to 7 different classes including *longitudinal crack*, *alligator crack*, *transverse crack*, and other: *other corruption*, *pothole*, *block crack*, and *repair*.

Images in the Road Damage Detection 2022 dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 21693 (46% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (38385 images) and *test* (9035 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 4 countries: ***Japan*** (13133 images), ***Norway*** (10201 images), ***India*** (9665 images), and ***United States*** (6005 images). Additionally, every image from ***China*** marked with the ***drone*** or ***motorbike*** tag. Images labels have ***detail*** tag. Explore it in supervisely labeling tool. The dataset was released in 2022 by the JP-IN joint research group.
